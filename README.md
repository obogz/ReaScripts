# ReaperTonMidiRoll
Ableton like midi editor actions for Reaper

This version is an alpha. Highly unstable.

This project was started using this work: https://github.com/thenfour/ReaperScripts


TODO: 
- Make undo work properly
- Make back action work properly (delete if note is too small)
- optimise and cleanup the code
- see if there is another way to detect retriggerd notes besides comparing velocity

Long term:
- create an extension that alows more flexibility on the matter
