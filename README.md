# ReaPerTonMidiRoll
Ableton like midi editor step input actions for Reaper

THIS VERSION IS ALPHA!! Hightly unstable!!!

To install, copy the scripts to the reaper script directory and add them in your Midi Edito actions.
To use make sure you have the normal step recording option turned off!

This project was started using this work: https://github.com/thenfour/ReaperScripts


TODO: 
- Make undo work properly
- Make back action work properly (delete if note is too small)
- optimise and cleanup the code
- see if there is another way to detect retriggerd notes besides comparing velocity
- cleanup, cleanup some more, optimise, organise and add integration with ReaPack

Long term:
- create an jsfx extension that improves this
